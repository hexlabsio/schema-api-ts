# schema-api-ts

Takes an OpenApi 3.0 specification schema and generates Api classes, Model classes, SDKs to call APIs externally and Mocks to mock APIs.
It will also output a simplified definition of the paths and methods in order for you to process separately. 
(We uses it to generate API Gateway stacks in kloudformation-ts)
